# filmQuarry-client

# Purpose

Hello and welcome to **Film Quarry** ! My objective was to build a client side website using React to display the data from my backend Movie API! The project utilizes a single-page application with state routing to navigate between views and share URLs.

# What will it do?
The web application will provide users with access to information about different movies, directors, and genres. Users will be able to sign up, update their personal information, and create a list of their favorite movies.
